*****************************************************************************
Section A: The purpose of this software
This software reads in a compressor map image, then through certain manual help,
reads in all data so that they can be processed and generated automatically
by the machine. 

*****************************************************************************
Section B: How to Run?

MainWindow Page:
*****************************************************************************
Open the software and then either click File -> Open or Press “Command + O” to
open the image that you want to process. (Supports JPEG/JPG only.) Then you need
to first click on the top left corner of the *coordinate system*, and then the bottom
right corner to locate the exact coordinate of the image. Then hit “Next”.

Rotation Curve Approx.: 
*********************************************************************************************
In the next page, you will need to user Bézier Curve to approximate the rotation curves
on the image. We use Cubic Bézier curve in this case, so you need to first click on the
start point of the curve, then two control points, and finally the end point of the curve. 
You may click the button “Drag” on the side of the image view, to drag any of these points
for better approximation. After dragging, click on the “Drag” button again to continue with
setting up points. 

After you are done with approximation, enter the information (rotation speed) for the line. 
(NOTE that the order of information entering and the order of line approximation have to be exactly the same.)
You may delete all the lines and points on the scene by clicking “Delete Line”. You may also clear the information
storage by clicking on “Delete Storage”. When you are done, hit “Confirm and Store“ to go the the next page.

Efficiency Line Approx.:
*********************************************************************************************************************
This process is very similar to the above section. Since efficiency line usually comes in an oval shape(or similar), 
so you may need to use multiple bézier curves to approximate. After approximating the line, enter the information
IMMEDIATELY and hit “Next Line”. You will notice that the small green points are gone. This means that you’ve done
approximating one efficiency line. When you are completely done, hit “Confirm and Store”

Display Table and Export:
*********************************************************************************************************************
You have reached the last page! In this interface, you will first need to enter the X, Y min and max value in the image
and then hit “Confirm”. The original image will disappear and return a new, automatically generated new image. The software
will automatically find intersections between rotation curves and efficiency lines. However, you may also manually click on
the interface to enter data yourself. Click “Export as CSV” when you are done.

Then you will need to enter Temperature and Pressure information so as to reduce and adjust the orignal speed 
and mass flow info. Select the place that suits you the best to store the output CSV file.
